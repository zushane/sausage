Project: Sausage
=======

[Wikipedia defines a sausage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausage) as "a food usually made from ground meat, often pork, beef or veal, along with salt, spices and breadcrumbs, with a skin around it."

Doesn't that sound enticing?  Don't you like sausages? No? Why not?

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of sausages. Feel free to make a pull request if you would like to add anything.
